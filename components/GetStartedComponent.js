                        Recently one of our two teams had an exciting win at the FIRST Tech Challenge Provincials in Surrey, BC. As a result, we have earned the incredible opportunity to go to the World Championships in Houston, Texas, this April.<br /><br />

                        We are hoping to send 20 people, including students, teachers and mentors on the trip. It is a valuable learning experience; for many students, it will be the only chance they have for an opportunity as monumental as this. One where they will get to meet and collaborate with teams from around the world.<br /><br />

                        We hope you can help us get to Texas to compete in this event. The total cost of the trip would be around $50,000 Canadian; this is mainly just airfare and accommodations. This is approximately $2,500 per student and along with our expenses up to this point is cost prohibitive and cost can be a barrier for many students.<br /><br />

                        The Reynolds Reybots are a school-based team that designs and builds competition robots. The team meets year-round and operates like a small business, with different sub-teams that handle everything from marketing and fundraising to programming, mechanics, and electrical work. We operate on an apprenticeship model, where more experienced students lead and mentor more junior students to gain the skills and knowledge required. The collaborative effort of running a team and building and competing with robots provides a real world learning environment that is fun, exciting, and rewarding. As FIRST® founder Dean Kamen said, &quot;We don’t use kids to build robots. We use robots to build kids.&quot;<br /><br />

                        FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people’s interest in science and technology. The not-for-profit organization designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills. The Reybots participate in the two highest levels of competition, FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC) and FIRST® Tech Challenge (FTC). Please see our website, Reybots.ca, for more information on our specific team.<br /><br />

                        Universities and employers recognize the crucible that FIRST® participants have been fired through, value their experience and skills, and actively recruit such students. Participation in robotics provides students with exposure to real world applications of math, science, and technology that are often missing from their academic classes, and motivates students for participation in post-secondary STEM programs. Graduated students from the Reynolds Robotics Team have gone on to attend programs in Computer Science, Engineering, Science, and Trades.<br /><br />

                        We are looking for sponsors who will cheer us on year after year and ultimately become part of the Reynolds Reybots family. How the funds will be used can be seen in the chart below. Because this is an extracurricular activity, this would not be possible without grants and generous donations from generous people and companies like you/yours. Sponsors for Reybots make a positive contribution to the education, well-being, and eventual careers of students who get to participate. Upwards of 30 children participate in some role every year during the competition season and we hope to grow this.<br /><br />

                        Our sponsorship goal for 2022-2023 is to raise $15,000. Sponsor money received will go directly towards the expenses required to run the team each year, including competition registration, parts, tools, and travel. <br /><br />

                            <li>As we become a more senior team, some of the grants offered by FIRST are less available, and our expenses can jump significantly when we qualify for World&apos;s down in Houston.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Be a donor: this is eligible for tax receipts if done through the school district. Details can be found in the button down below and you will be included with other individuals and companies in the donor section of our webpage if you wish.</li>
                                <li>Be a Sponsor: for Canada Revenue Agency Purposes this is separated from regular donors as it comes with a form of expected benefit. Sponsors are not eligible for a tax receipt through the school district. If you want to be a sponsor, discuss directly with us how much you would want to sponsor to have your name displayed on our robots, shirts and online materials. </li>
                                <li>Pledge funds: One of our biggest financial difficulties is not knowing if we will qualify for world championships, and then having to frantically obtain funds. If you or your company are willing to pledge funds conditinally if we qualify, either as a donor or sponsor, please reach out to us directly.</li>
